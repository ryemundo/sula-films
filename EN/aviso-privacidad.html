            <p>
              SULAFILMS, S.A. DE C.V. (hereinafter "SULAFILMS"), with registered
              address at Calle Campeche, number 295, Int A. Del. Cuauhtémoc.
              Hipódromo Condesa, CP 06170, as the party responsible for
              collecting your personal data, in accordance with the Federal Law
              on the Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties, its
              regulations, and other applicable provisions, hereby notifies you
              of the following:
            </p>
            <h4>Personal Data</h4>
            <p>The personal data that Sulafilms stores are:</p>
            <p>Identification and contact information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Full name</li>
              <li>Address</li>
              <li>Telephone number</li>
              <li>Email</li>
              <li>Image or photograph</li>
              <li>Autograph signature</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There are options within our website where we may obtain personal
              data from a third party (for example, a website may allow you to
              send information about our products and services to a friend, in
              which case we will require that person's name and email address).
              To do this, we require that you have the consent of that person.
              Therefore, if you send us such information, we will understand
              that you have previously requested the authorization of the data
              subject to share it with us.
            </p>
            <h4>Personal data of minors</h4>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, our website and the services we offer are not
              intended for minors. However, if personal data of minors is
              obtained, used, or stored, it will be done with the consent of
              their parents or guardians. When a minor is identified as such, we
              include instructions to obtain the consent of their parents or
              guardians before the minor provides us with any personal data. If
              you are the parent or guardian of a minor who has provided their
              personal data without your consent, you may request the exercise
              of any of your ARCO rights by sending an email to
              <a href="mailto:info@sulaentertainment.com"
                >info@sulaentertainment.com</a
              >.
            </p>
            <h4>Purposes of the processing of personal data</h4>
            <p>Sulafilms will process your data for the following purposes:</p>
            <h5>Primary:</h5>

              <li>
                Maintain the security and integrity of our systems, our
                facilities, and our personnel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Open, maintain, manage, and monitor the accounts you have with
                us.
              </li>
              <li>Provide services and assistance.</li>
              <li>
                Respond to your questions, requests for information, comments,
                or suggestions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Occasionally, Sulafilms obtains certain data from publicly
              available sources in order to contact you and provide you with
              information about our products and services. In such cases, you
              may opt out of receiving our information at any time by sending us
              an email to:
              <a href="mailto:info@sulaentertainment.com"
                >info@sulaentertainment.com</a
              >, srequesting that we stop processing your personal data.
            </p>
            <h4>Transfers of personal data</h4>
            <p>
              Only in the cases described in the Law, such as: compliance with
              legal provisions, requests from authorities, or transfers between
              our affiliated or subsidiary companies, will your personal data be
              transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the specific case of job candidates and employees, their data
              will be transferred when they request it in order to provide
              professional references to third parties or send their resumes to
              companies interested in them.
            </p>
            <h4>Rights of the owner regarding his personal data</h4>
            <p>
              You have the right to access your personal data and know the
              details of how it is processed, to rectify it if it is inaccurate
              or incomplete; to delete it when you consider that it is no longer
              necessary to fulfill the purposes that justified its collection,
              as well as to object to its processing for a legitimate reason
              ("ARCO" Rights). Likewise, you can limit the use and disclosure of
              your data, or revoke the consent you have given for its
              processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mechanism implemented for exercising these rights is through
              submitting the respective request to the email address
              <a href="mailto:info@sulaentertainment.com"
                >info@sulaentertainment.com</a
              >.
            </p>
            <h5>Your request must contain:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The name of the owner and address or other means to communicate
                the response to your request.
              </li>
              <li>
                Documents proving the identity or, where applicable, the legal
                representation of the owner.
              </li>
              <li>
                A clear and precise description of the personal data regarding
                which you seek to exercise any of the aforementioned rights; and
                any other element or document that facilitates the location of
                the personal data.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the case of rectification requests, the data subject must
                indicate, in addition to the above, the modifications to be made
                and provide documentation supporting the request.

            <p>
              Sulafilms will notify you, within a maximum of twenty business
              days, counting from the date on which the complete request for
              access, rectification, cancellation, or objection was received, of
              the decision made, so that, if appropriate, it may be made
              effective within fifteen business days following the date on which
              the response is communicated. The aforementioned deadlines may be
              extended once for an equal period, provided that the circumstances
              of the case justify it.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can stop receiving promotional messages by any means, such as
              email, landline or cell phone, and postal mail, by sending us an

            <h4>Use of Social Networks <i>Plug-ins</i></h4>
            <p>
              Plug-ins ("plug-ins") from the social networks facebook.com and
              Twitter may be added to our websites. The associated services are
              provided by Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., respectively
              ("Providers").
            </p>
            <p>
              Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave,
              Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). For an overview of Facebook
              plug-ins and their appearance, go to:
              <a
                href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins"
                target="_blank"
                >https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Twitter is operated by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900,
              San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. For an overview of Twitter options
              and their appearance, go to:
              <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button" target="_blank"

              >
            </p>
            <p>
              PTo increase data protection when you visit our websites, these
              plug-ins are implemented as "2-click buttons." This form of
              integration ensures that when you access a page within our website
              that contains such plug-ins, you are not automatically connected
              to the providers' servers. Only if you activate the plug-ins,
              thereby granting permission for data transmission, will your
              browser create a direct link to the providers' servers. The
              content of the various plug-ins is transmitted by the respective
              provider directly to the browser and then appears on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The plug-in tells the provider which of our websites you have
              accessed. If, while viewing our website, you log in to your
              Facebook or Twitter user account, the provider is able to match
              your interest, i.e., the information you are accessing, with your
              user account. When you use any of the plug-in functions (e.g.,
              clicking the "Like" button or leaving a comment), this information
              will also be transmitted by your browser directly to the provider
              for recording.
            </p>
            <p>
              PFor more information about this and the use of data by Facebook
              or Twitter, as well as the rights and options available to protect
              your privacy in these circumstances, you can find the providers'
